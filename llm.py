The story goes that during a hunting trip in Mississippi in 1902, Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear that had been tied up for him to shoot, deeming it unsportsmanlike. This act of compassion was widely publicized, and a political cartoon depicting the incident inspired a Brooklyn shopkeeper named Morris Michtom to create a stuffed bear and name it "Teddy's Bear" after the president. The toy became incredibly popular, and the name stuck, giving birth to the teddy bear we know today.""",
